## Bug — Definition (Frontend Context)

**Bug:**
A bug is any **unintended or incorrect behavior in the frontend** where the application does **not work as expected according to requirements, design, or standard web behavior**.

### Key Characteristics of a Bug

- Causes **wrong functionality**, broken flow, or UI failure
- Deviates from **approved design, requirements, or user expectations**
- Affects **user experience, correctness, or accessibility**

### Frontend Bug Examples

- Button not clickable
- Form submits incorrect data
- UI breaks on mobile screen
- JavaScript error in console
- Incorrect validation message
- Layout overflow or misalignment
- API response not handled properly in UI

> **Rule of thumb:**
> If the user sees something **not working correctly**, it’s a **bug**.

## Refactoring — Definition (Frontend Context)

**Refactoring:**
Refactoring is the process of **restructuring or improving existing frontend code** to enhance **readability, maintainability, performance, or structure**, **without changing the observable behavior of the application**.

### Key Characteristics of Refactoring

- No change in features or UI behavior
- No change in business logic
- Improves code quality or performance
- Reduces duplication or complexity

### Frontend Refactoring Examples

- Renaming variables/functions for clarity
- Extracting reusable components or hooks
- Removing unused code
- Simplifying conditional logic
- Improving folder structure
- Optimizing re-renders (memoization)
- Converting inline styles to CSS classes

> **Rule of thumb:**
> If the user **cannot tell anything changed**, but the code is better—it's **refactoring**.

## One-Line Comparison (Very Useful for Reports)

| Aspect              | Bug                    | Refactoring             |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Purpose             | Fix incorrect behavior | Improve code quality    |
| User-visible change | Yes                    | No                      |
| Functional impact   | Fixes broken flow      | Same behavior           |
| Risk level          | Medium–High            | Low (if done correctly) |

## Professional Statement You Can Copy-Paste

> **Bug fixes address defects where the frontend behavior deviates from expected functionality, while refactoring focuses on improving code structure and quality without altering application behavior.**
