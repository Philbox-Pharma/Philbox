## Overview

This project follows a modified Git Flow strategy with three main branches and feature-based development. This approach ensures code quality, enables parallel development, and maintains stable releases.

**Key Principles:**
- Never commit directly to `main`, `staging`, or `dev`
- Always work in feature branches
- All changes must go through Pull Requests (PRs)
- Keep branches up-to-date with their parent branch

## Branch Structure

```
main (Production)
  │
  └── staging (Pre-production/QA)
        │
        └── dev (Development/Integration)
              │
              ├── feature/user-authentication
              ├── feature/dashboard-ui
              ├── feature/payment-integration
              └── bugfix/login-validation
```

### Main Branches

| Branch | Purpose | Protected | Deploy To |
|--------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| `main` | Production-ready code only | ✅ Yes | Production |
| `staging` | Pre-production testing & QA | ✅ Yes | Staging Server |
| `dev` | Integration of all features | ✅ Yes | Development Server |

### Working Branches

These are temporary branches created by developers for specific tasks.

---

## Branch Naming Conventions

Use lowercase with hyphens and be descriptive:

### Format: `type/short-description`

**Types:**

| Prefix | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `feature/` | New feature development | `feature/user-profile` |
| `bugfix/` | Bug fixes in development | `bugfix/login-timeout` |
| `hotfix/` | Urgent production fixes | `hotfix/payment-crash` |
| `refactor/` | Code refactoring | `refactor/api-structure` |
| `docs/` | Documentation updates | `docs/api-endpoints` |
| `test/` | Test additions/fixes | `test/user-authentication` |

**Examples:**
```
✅ feature/user-authentication
✅ bugfix/navbar-responsive
✅ hotfix/security-patch
❌ Feature/User-Authentication (wrong case)
❌ user-auth (missing type)
❌ fix (not descriptive)
```

## Workflow Guide

### 1. Starting New Work

```bash
# Step 1: Switch to dev branch
git checkout dev

# Step 2: Get latest changes
git pull origin dev

# Step 3: Create your feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Step 4: Verify you're on the right branch
git branch
```

### 2. During Development

```bash
# Make changes to your code...

# Step 1: Check what files changed
git status

# Step 2: Stage your changes
git add .
# Or stage specific files
git add path/to/file.js

# Step 3: Commit with a clear message
git commit -m "Add user authentication form"

# Step 4: Push to remote
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

**Commit Message Guidelines:**
```
✅ "Add user login validation"
✅ "Fix navbar collapse on mobile"
✅ "Update README with API documentation"
❌ "fix"
❌ "changes"
❌ "asdfgh"
```

### 3. Keeping Your Branch Updated

Update your feature branch with latest `dev` changes regularly (at least daily):

```bash
# Step 1: Switch to dev and update
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev

# Step 2: Switch back to your feature branch
git checkout feature/your-feature-name

# Step 3: Merge dev into your branch
git merge dev

# Step 4: If conflicts occur, resolve them, then:
git add .
git commit -m "Merge dev into feature branch"

# Step 5: Push updated branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### 4. Completing Your Work

```bash
# Step 1: Ensure all changes are committed and pushed
git status
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Step 2: Go to GitHub/GitLab and create a Pull Request
# Target branch: dev
# Source branch: feature/your-feature-name

# Step 3: Wait for code review and approval

# Step 4: After merge, delete your feature branch
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
```

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Starting a New Feature

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feature/new-dashboard
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "Add dashboard layout"
git push origin feature/new-dashboard
# Create PR: feature/new-dashboard → dev
```

### Scenario 2: Fixing a Bug in Development

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b bugfix/fix-login-error
# ... fix the bug ...
git add .
git commit -m "Fix login validation error"
git push origin bugfix/fix-login-error
# Create PR: bugfix/fix-login-error → dev
```

### Scenario 3: Urgent Production Hotfix

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-security-fix
# ... fix the issue ...
git add .
git commit -m "Patch security vulnerability"
git push origin hotfix/critical-security-fix
# Create PR: hotfix/critical-security-fix → main
# After merge, also merge main into staging and dev
```

### Scenario 4: Resolving Merge Conflicts

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout feature/your-feature
git merge dev

# If conflicts occur:
# 1. Open conflicted files (marked in terminal)
# 2. Look for conflict markers: <<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>
# 3. Edit files to resolve conflicts
# 4. Remove conflict markers

git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts with dev"
git push origin feature/your-feature
```

### Scenario 5: Multiple Developers on Same Feature

Create a shared feature branch:

```bash
# Lead developer creates main feature branch
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout -b feature/dashboard
git push origin feature/dashboard

# Developer A creates sub-branch
git checkout feature/dashboard
git checkout -b feature/dashboard-header
# ... work and push ...
# Create PR: feature/dashboard-header → feature/dashboard

# Developer B creates another sub-branch
git checkout feature/dashboard
git checkout -b feature/dashboard-sidebar
# ... work and push ...
# Create PR: feature/dashboard-sidebar → feature/dashboard

# Finally, merge feature/dashboard → dev
```

## Best Practices

### Do's ✅

- **Commit frequently** with meaningful messages
- **Pull from dev daily** to stay updated
- **Keep PRs small** and focused (easier to review)
- **Write clear PR descriptions** explaining what and why
- **Test your changes** before creating a PR
- **Review your own code** before requesting review
- **Delete branches** after they're merged
- **Communicate** with team about complex changes

### Don'ts ❌

- **Never commit directly** to `main`, `staging`, or `dev`
- **Don't commit** sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- **Avoid huge PRs** with 50+ file changes
- **Don't ignore conflicts** - resolve them properly
- **Never force push** (`git push -f`) to shared branches
- **Don't leave** console.logs or commented code
- **Avoid generic commit messages** like "fix" or "update"

### Code Quality Checklist

Before creating a PR, ensure:

- [ ] Code is properly formatted
- [ ] No console.logs or debug statements
- [ ] No commented-out code blocks
- [ ] Variables have meaningful names
- [ ] Complex logic has comments
- [ ] No hardcoded values (use config/env)

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: I'm on the wrong branch

```bash
# Save your current work
git stash

# Switch to correct branch
git checkout correct-branch-name

# Apply your saved work
git stash pop
```

### Problem: I committed to the wrong branch

```bash
# If you haven't pushed yet:
git reset HEAD~1  # Undo last commit, keep changes
git stash  # Save changes
git checkout correct-branch
git stash pop  # Apply changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your message"
```

### Problem: I need to undo my last commit

```bash
# Undo commit but keep changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo commit and discard changes (careful!)
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

### Problem: My branch is far behind dev

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull origin dev
git checkout your-branch
git rebase dev  # Reapply your changes on top of dev

# If conflicts occur, resolve them, then:
git rebase --continue

# Force push your rebased branch (only for your own branch)
git push origin your-branch --force-with-lease
```

### Problem: I accidentally deleted important code

```bash
# Find the commit where code existed
git reflog

# Restore from that commit
git checkout <commit-hash> -- path/to/file
```

### Problem: Pull request has conflicts

```bash
# Update your branch with target branch
git checkout your-branch
git pull origin dev
# Resolve conflicts in your editor
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve conflicts"
git push origin your-branch
```

## Branch Protection Rules (For Admin)

Configure these settings in GitHub/GitLab:

### For `main`, `staging`, `dev`:
- ✅ Require pull request before merging
- ✅ Require at least 1 approval
- ✅ Require status checks to pass
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date
- ✅ Prevent force pushes
- ✅ Prevent deletion
